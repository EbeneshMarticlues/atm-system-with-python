# atm-system-with-python

This code defines an Account class with an account number, PIN, and balance, and an ATM class with methods for checking the balance, withdrawing funds, and depositing funds. The main block of code creates some test accounts and demonstrates the functionality of the ATM class.

Note that this is a simplified example and does not include any security measures beyond the use of a PIN. A real-world ATM system would likely include additional security features such as encryption, authentication, and transaction logging.
